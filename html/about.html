        As the amount of testing between countries varies a lot, it is impossible to know the real number of
        infections.<br/>
        That's why I chosen to chart the deaths only, as those are probably much more reliably reported.

    <p>
        The consequence of this is that the charts are showing a peak in the past, the situation 2-3 weeks ago, the time
        when the people who later died got infected.<br/>
        The effects of the social distancing will appear only 2-3 weeks later than the date they came into effect.

        I excluded San Marino from the population data because it is an outlier (much more deaths compared to population
        size than any other country), and it would make the other countries look too similar to each other.
